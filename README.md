Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a powerful mathematical approach for modeling and analyzing systems affected by random noise. In nature there are many processes or phenomena that evolve with the effect of random noise. Solve SDE are non trivial but there are mathematical as well as computational techniques for do it. In this project, we explore some physics_based model and data-driven model to determine the force field parameters from stochastic trajectories.
